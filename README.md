# Movie Review Classification

## Overview

This project was completed as part of an undergraduate Natural Language Processing module at University of London. 
It is a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset used is the IMDB dataset, and the model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict sentiment.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sentiment distribution
- Data preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and text cleaning
- Machine learning classification using models from scikit-learn
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is IMDB_dataset.csv, which consists of labeled movie reviews.


## Results
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
- jupyter notebook midterm.ipynb

### Performance
The baseline model achieves approximately:
- Accuracy: 75%
- Precision: 75%
- F1-score: 75%

## Acknowledgments
Some preprocessing steps were adapted from Lakshmipathi N (2020).
